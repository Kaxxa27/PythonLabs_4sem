Hi, Jeka! Hello Mr.Marple. Hi.  How are you? Etc.
There are five types of schools in the US educational system?!
They are: kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school etc. And private school.
Children go to Mr. kindergarten when they are 5 years old They go to elementary school from...
Ages 6 through 11 (1-5 grades), middle school from ages 12 through 14 (6-8 grades) and high school from ages 15 through 19 (9-12 grades).
About 90 percent of all vs. children attend public school, which is free.
The other Mrs. 10 percent go i private schools, which often include religious education.
They are similar to the public schools but parents must pay for their children to go to these schools.
About half of all private schools are run by Catholics.
Mr. Eugene, you are Jr. or Sr.?
